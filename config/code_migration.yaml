      <uploaded_files>
      {{working_dir}}
      </uploaded_files>
      I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory {{working_dir}}. Consider the following PR description:

      <pr_description>
      {{problem_statement}}
      </pr_description>

      **Your Task:**
      Your goal is to implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met. Please make minimal, targeted changes only to the non-test files in the {{working_dir}} directory. This means **you should not modify any test files or the logic of existing tests** unless they are directly affected by the migration.

      Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

      1. **Read and Understand Relevant Code:**
        - As a first step, identify the functions, classes, or files related to the changes required by the <pr_description>.
        - Study the logic and flow of the existing code before making changes. If the repository has README files or documentation, refer to those to get context on its functionality.

      2. **Before attempting edits, you must first gather relevant context using the `web_search_tool`. This tool helps you look up documentation, code examples, and usage patterns for any Python library, API, or function.**

        Use it by asking a clear and specific *question* about the concept you're working with. Frame the query as something you would ask a search engine or documentation assistant. For example:
        
        - `"How to use the Click library in Python?"`
        - `"What does pandas.DataFrame.to_csv do?"`
        - `"How to add validation with pydantic?"`

        â›” Do **not** attempt to edit code or answer questions before calling this tool, especially if the library, method, or concept is unfamiliar.
      3. **Edit the Code to Resolve the Issue:**
        - Modify the relevant **functions** or **modules** in the codebase to address the requirements in the <pr_description>. **Focus only on the areas related to the migration task.**
        - Make sure that you do not introduce unnecessary changes that are outside the scope of the problem.
        - When changing code:
          - **Completely remove deprecated code** or elements that are no longer needed. Do not simply comment them out; remove them entirely.
          - Ensure the code is **clean** and follows any style or formatting guidelines present in the repository.
        
      4. After completing the task, summarize the changes you made to the codebase using the following JSON format. When you start the summary, start with "Here is the summary of the changes in the specified JSON format":

          ```json
          {
            "files": [
              {
                "path": "<file_path>",
                "code_changes": [
                  {
                    "line": "<line_number(s)>",
                    "cardinality": "<one-to-one/one-to-many/etc.>",
                    "source_program_elements": ["<source_element>"],
                    "target_program_elements": ["<target_element>"],
                    "properties": ["<properties>"],
                    "source_apis": ["<source_api>"],
                    "target_apis": ["<target_api>"]
                  }
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
          ```

      **Guidelines for filling the JSON fields:**  
      - **Only use the predefined values** listed below. **Do not invent new terms.**  
      - If a field does not apply (e.g., if code was removed rather than modified), leave the list empty rather than filling it incorrectly.  

      **ProgramElement:**  
      - import  
      - exception  
      - function call  
      - attribute  
      - decorator  
      - function reference  
      - type  

      **Cardinality:**  
      - zero-to-one  
      - one-to-zero  
      - one-to-one  
      - one-to-many  
      - many-to-one  
      - many-to-many  
      - not applicable  

      **Property:**  
      - element name change  
      - argument addition  
      - argument deletion  
      - argument name change  
      - argument transformation  
      - async transformation  
      - output transformation  
      - parameter addition to decorated function 

      Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

          Thank you for your work on this issue. Please carefully follow the steps below to help review your changes.

          1. If you made any changes to your code after running the reproduction script, please run the reproduction script again.
            If the reproduction script is failing, please revisit your changes and make sure they are correct.
            If you have already removed your reproduction script, please ignore this step.
          2. Remove your reproduction script (if you haven't done so already).
          3. If you have modified any TEST files, please revert them to the state they had before you started fixing the issue.
